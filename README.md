# **Just Create‚öôÔ∏è**

Minecraft modpack based on "Create" mod

## üìî What is it for?
Most of modern tech(not only Create ones) are **REALLY bloated**

Goal of this modpack is to provide vanilla Create mod experience, minimizing bloat.

There is no "1000 conflicting keybinds" or so.

## Versions
This modpack is built for multiplayer that contains mods like "[Open Parties and Claims](https://modrinth.com/mod/open-parties-and-claims) and "[Simple Voice Chat](https://modrinth.com/plugin/simple-voice-chat)". But if you want to play it in singleplayer, there is a "Singleplayer version" that doesn't contain those.

### Overall there is:
- Multiplayer version for clients
- Multiplayer version for servers
- Singleplayer version

## Server setup
This modpack contain a simple server build, to start it:
1. Run the installer.
2. Move `mods/` and `config/` to the server config
3. Run `run.sh` or `run.bat`(depending on your system).
4. If you ever run a server, you know what to do next.
